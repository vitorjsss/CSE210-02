# Hilo

To play Hilo you will need to guess if the number of the next card is higher or lower than the number of the current card. You start with 300, if you answer right you will get more 100 points, but if you lose, you will lose 75. If you reach 0 points, game over.

## Getting Started

project folder. Select the main module inside the game folder and click the "run" button.
